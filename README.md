# Welcome to LangChain Project

## Introduction

Current scope of the project is to utilize the power of LangChain to test various puplicly available NLP models and compare their performance on various tasks. Data will be collected from various sources such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, etc. and will be used to build a profile of the user. 

This includes:
- ChatGPT

## Getting Started

**LangChain** is a project that aims to create a platform for language learning. The platform will be a web application that will allow users to learn a language by reading and listening to texts in that language. The platform will also provide tools for users to practice speaking and writing in the language they are learning.

**Agents** are the main entities in the system. They are responsible for interacting with the users and providing them with the necessary information and tools to learn a language. Agents can be human or AI-based.
In this project, agenct act as a brain of the system that decides what data to collect, what models to use, and how to present the data to the user.

In LangChain. agent is composed of the following components:
- Tools: It acts like a wrapper for the python funtions, making it accessible to the LLM.
- Agents
- Toolkits
- Agent Executor

TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Scraping data from various sources
    1.    LinkedIn (ProxyCurl)
2.	LangChain API
3.	Sentiment Analysis
